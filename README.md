# Regenscore: Get NFT's (Permissionless II hackathon contribution) 
Regenscore is a platform where regens can unlock airdrops for creating value. We do this by aggregating open data, measuring positive actions on a network, platform, or protocol, and create incentives for people who level up and unlock crypto rewards.

We believe crypto should be a win win game where networks, platforms and protocols can grow and thrive while the people who perform positive actions can also flourish. We are inspired by projects like Gitcoin and authors like Kevin Owocki, and aim to help the ecosystem grow in alignment with the values of regen cryptoeconomics. 

This application is made in the 24-hour [Permissionless II hackathon](https://blockworks.co/event/permissionless-2023-hackathon/home) and submitted to the following challenges:

# Gitcoin Passport dashboard data
For the metrics on the homepage, we used the [Gitcoin Passport API](https://docs.passport.gitcoin.co/building-with-passport/api-reference#available-endpoints) in order to scrape score and stamp data from all addresses with an [Gitcoin Passport on-chain attestation](https://optimism.easscan.org/address/0x843829986e895facd330486a61Ebee9E1f1adB1a). Please note that this has a bias to more advanced used users (as they would benefit from on-chain stamps).
